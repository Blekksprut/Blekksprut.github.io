    <h3>Dogwalker & Pet Sitter/DoorDasher March 2021 - October 2023</h3>
    <p>
      While I was studying, I picked up a few odd jobs to get by. I did some
      part-time food delivery with DoorDash. I also worked as a self-employed
      dog walker and pet sitter, caring for all kinds of animals including dogs,
      cats, rabbits, fish, and even a scorpion!
